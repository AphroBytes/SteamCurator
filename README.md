# SteamCurator
The Steam Marketplace is known for placing small to medium sized game publishers on the back pages of advertisements on steam home. (Even if its a $60 game that is now being offered for $0.00 for a limited time, per the game studio) leaving otherwise unbelievable game deals to go un-noticed. We think this is unacceptable. This is a project utilizing steams API's and Pythons flexibility to automatically scan the market for free game deals and 'scoop' games that would otherwise cost anywhere from a cup of coffe to an average fast food order. Save money and get free games. It's simple.
